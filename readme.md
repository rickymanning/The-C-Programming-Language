# The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) 
##Background
The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) is a book about C written by B. Kernighan and D. Ritchie - the writer of the first ever C tutorial and the creator of C respectively. The first edition is commonly referred to as K&R C after the authors and seems to be a legendary, almost mythical book amongst programmers of a certain vintage. Written in the late 1970s, K&R C became the de-facto C standard. 

The second edition is refresh of the book, bringing it up to date, in the wake of a new standard as defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and is thus commonly known as ANSI C.

Due to changes at work, I for the first time, will need to learn C and learn it well. After the briefest of Google searches and after subsequent conversations with some (more) senior members of the Design and Development team it became apparent that I needn't look much further than this book.
##Project
This project will document all of the examples and exercises within, as I go through them. I will endeavour to write them exactly as they appear in the book, allowing for a brief comment at the top of files, specifying the name and page of the example in the book.
