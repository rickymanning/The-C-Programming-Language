# The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) 
##Background
The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) is a book about C written by B. Kernighan and D. Ritchie; the writer of the first ever C tutorial, and the creator of C, respectively. The first edition is commonly referred to as "K&R C", after the authors and seems to be a legendary, almost mythical book amongst programmers of a certain vintage. Written in the late 1970s, K&R C became the de-facto C standard. 

The second edition is a refresh of the book, bringing it up to date, in the wake of a new standard as defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and is thus commonly known as ANSI C.

Due to changes at work, I, for the first time, will need to learn C and learn it well. After the briefest of Google searches and after subsequent conversations with some (more) senior members of the Design and Development team it became apparent that I needn't look much further than this book.
##Project
This project will document all of the examples and exercises within, as I go through them. I will endeavour to write them exactly as they appear in the book, allowing for a brief comment at the top of files, specifying the name and page of the example in the book.
